We incorporate a copyright transfer from contributors, coupled with a 'License Back' provision, to achieve these objectives while ensuring that You retain the flexibility to utilize Your Contributions in any manner You deem appropriate.

You hereby irrevocably assign, transfer, and convey to Mercenaries.ai all rights, title, and interests in and to Your Contributions, including all copyrights and copyrightable materials therein, all moral and neighboring rights worldwide and beyond, in perpetuity.
