    socketOpts:
      format: 'base64'
    description: The image data as a base64-encoded string or a Google Cloud Storage URI.
  features:
    required: true
    type: string
    description: The features to detect in the image. Choices include LABEL_DETECTION, TEXT_DETECTION, FACE_DETECTION, etc.
    choices:
    - title: Text Detection
      description: Optical character recognition (OCR) for an image; identifies and extracts UTF-8 text in an image, optimized for sparse areas of text within a larger image.
      value: TEXT_DETECTION
    - title: Document Text Detection
      description: Optical character recognition (OCR) for dense text images or files (PDF/TIFF); optimized for dense areas of text and images that contain handwriting.
      value: DOCUMENT_TEXT_DETECTION
    - title: Landmark Detection
      description: Provides the name of the landmark, a confidence score, and a bounding box in the image for the landmark along with coordinates for the detected entity.
      value: LANDMARK_DETECTION
    - title: Logo Detection
      description: Identifies logos in the image, providing a textual description, confidence score, and bounding polygon for the identified logo.
      value: LOGO_DETECTION
    - title: Label Detection
      description: Provides generalized labels for an image, returning a textual description, confidence score, and topicality rating for each label.
      value: LABEL_DETECTION
    - title: Image Properties
      description: Returns dominant colors in an image along with confidence scores and the fraction of pixels occupied by each color.
      value: IMAGE_PROPERTIES
    - title: Object Localization
      description: Provides label and bounding box annotations for multiple objects recognized in a single image.
      value: OBJECT_LOCALIZATION
    - title: Crop Hint Detection
      description: Provides a bounding polygon for the cropped image, confidence score, and an importance fraction of the salient region with respect to the original image.
      value: CROP_HINTS
    - title: Web Entities and Pages
      description: Provides related web content to an image, including web entities, matching images, pages with matching images, visually similar images, and a best guess label.
      value: WEB_DETECTION
    - title: Explicit Content Detection (SafeSearch)
      description: Provides likelihood ratings for explicit content categories including adult, spoof, medical, violence, and racy.
      value: SAFE_SEARCH_DETECTION
    - title: Face Detection
      description: Locates faces with bounding polygons and identifies specific facial landmarks along with likelihood ratings for emotions and general image properties.
      value: FACE_DETECTION
